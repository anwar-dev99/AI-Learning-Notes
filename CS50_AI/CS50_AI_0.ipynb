        "Search algorithms are fundamental building blocks of AI and computer science.  \n",
        "They help machines efficiently navigate and solve problems, whether finding a path in a maze, searching for information in a massive dataset, or making strategic decisions.\n",

        "## Fundamental AI Search Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Agent\n",
        "An agent is any entity that makes decisions in an environment. Examples:\n",
        "- A robot navigating a maze.\n",
        "- A self-driving car deciding how to move.\n",
        "- An AI player in a game.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. State\n",
        "A state represents the current condition of the agent and environment. Examples:\n",
        "- The position of a robot in a maze.\n",
        "- The board configuration in a chess game.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Actions\n",
        "These are possible moves an agent can take from a given state. Examples:\n",
        "- A robot can move (**UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**).\n",
        "- A chess AI can move a piece.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Transition Model\n",
        "Defines how actions lead to new states.\n",
        "- **Example:** If a robot moves **RIGHT**, the new state reflects the updated position.\n",
        "- **In Chess:** Moving a knight follows a specific rule for position change.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. State Space\n",
        "The set of all possible states in a problem. Examples:\n",
        "- Every position a robot can be in within a maze.\n",
        "- All possible board configurations in chess.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Goal Test\n",
        "Checks whether the agent has reached the goal state. Examples:\n",
        "- The robot reaches the exit of a maze.\n",
        "- A chess AI puts the opponent in checkmate.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. Path Cost\n",
        "The total cost of reaching the goal from the start state.\n",
        "- **Example:** If each movement in a maze costs **1**, a solution requiring **5 moves** has a path cost of **5**.\n",
        "- **A\\*** search algorithm considers **path cost + heuristics** to find the best path.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Summary\n",
        "In AI search problems, several fundamental elements define the structure of the problem-solving process. The **initial state** represents where the agent starts, such as a robot’s position in a maze. The **actions** describe the possible moves the agent can take, like moving **up, down, left, or right**. The **transition model** determines how actions lead to new states, ensuring each move updates the agent's position logically. The **goal test** checks if the agent has successfully reached the desired outcome, such as finding the shortest path to an exit. Finally, the **path cost function** evaluates the efficiency of a solution by measuring **travel time, resource usage, or movement penalties**. These elements are critical in developing AI systems for **pathfinding, game strategies, and complex decision-making processes** in robotics, computer vision, and machine learning optimization. Understanding them allows AI to **navigate and solve problems efficiently**.\n",

        "\n",
        "In AI search problems, a **node** is a fundamental data structure that helps track the progress of the search. Each node contains:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **State** → Represents the current situation in the search space.\n",
        "- **Parent** → The previous node that led to this state (helps trace the solution path).\n",
        "- **Action** → The move taken to reach this node.\n",
        "- **Path Cost** → The accumulated cost from the start state to this node.\n",

        "The **frontier** stores nodes that need to be explored.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Start with a node containing the **initial state**.\n",
        "- The frontier acts as a **list of places to explore next**.\n",
        "- First, the **starting position** is placed into the frontier.\n",

        "### 2. Repeat Until Solution Found or No Solution Exists\n",
        "- If the frontier is **empty**, no solution exists.\n",

        "- **Remove** a node from the frontier (based on the search strategy).\n",
        "- If the node contains the **goal state**, return the solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Expand the Node\n",
        "- **Generate new nodes** based on possible actions.\n",
        "- **Add** the resulting nodes to the frontier.\n",

        "2. If it reaches the **goal state**, it stops and delivers the package.\n",
        "3. Otherwise, it **expands the node**, generating **new positions** based on available moves.\n",
